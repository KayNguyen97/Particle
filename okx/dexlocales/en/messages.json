  "blockchain_bot_desc_faq1": "The OKX blockchain infrastructure is a comprehensive suite of underlying infrastructure services developed by OKX. With a wide range of API/SDK services, it simplifies the complexity of Web3 application development. The already available RPC service includes API and RPC functionality, providing users with powerful and comprehensive blockchain interaction capabilities for their Web3 projects. Soon, the transaction fortification service will be launched, focusing on API and enhanced features to make user transactions more affordable, faster, and more secure and reliable.",
  "blockchain_bot_desc_faq2": "Building upon OKX's robust foundational parsing capabilities, the blockchain infrastructure will offer an extensive range of node API and RPC services. This supports the diverse growth of the ecosystem and provides users with the potential for flexible adaptability, thereby greatly reducing the complexity and challenges of Web3 application development. Additionally, leveraging the stability and high performance of the infrastructure, it assists users in easing operational burdens and enhancing the overall efficiency and performance of their products.",
  "blockchain_bot_desc_faq3": "The RPC service offered by OKX, is a fundamental service for Web3 project developers and organizations. Its main objective is to streamline blockchain interaction operations. By implementing robust node services and adopting a standardized API design, it caters to various user application scenarios, including wallets and exchanges. This guarantees reliable and accurate data retrieval and processing.",
  "blockchain_bot_desc_faq4": "RPC allows developers, decentralized applications (DApps), and wallets to establish communication with the blockchain on demand. In the realm of Web3, connecting to a full or archival node is often facilitated through an RPC (Remote Procedure Call) service. This grants DApps, wallets, and protocols access to blockchain nodes, empowering them with the essential information needed to perform tasks like transaction execution and balance inquiries.",
  "blockchain_bot_desc_faq5": "RPC is a specific type of API that empowers developers and their applications to fetch data from the blockchain and remotely execute code on a server. This protocol facilitates sending requests to remote systems and receiving responses, enabling operations like querying blockchain status, submitting transactions, and receiving the status of specific transactions.",
  "blockchain_bot_desc_faq6": "RPC (Remote Procedure Call) provides clients with a range of command and operation types through the request method. This enables clients to send requests to blockchain nodes, either to retrieve specific information or perform specific actions.",
  "blockchain_bot_desc_faq7": "Currently, OKX's RPC service is exclusively open for the BRC-20 protocol on the BTC network. However, OKX's underlying infrastructure has been designed to support multiple blockchains, and will be progressively opened in the future.",
  "blockchain_bot_desc_faq8": "Currently, this product is invitation-only. To apply for an API key, please reach out to us at wallet@okx.com via email. Approved users will enjoy free services and can seamlessly integrate them into their applications using the provided technical documentation, thereby supporting Web3 application development. OKX eagerly anticipates user participation and feedback to foster the advancement of Web3.",
